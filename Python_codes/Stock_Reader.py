# this is a program that should read data in real time so that it can take in numbers and values from stock websites that tracks stoc value and then tell us if 
# a stock shows " ^ Bullish patterns" or " \/ Bearish patterns" this would be usefull for day trading(meaning hour term trading) we can text the program with random 
# number generators and light research shows that 5 minute to 15 minute time frames are the best to use with stocks 

# how would we do it 
# we can take in numbers from .5 minute trades then simplify into our useable data ( like the chart you did)
# then we have our program read the data determine if it fits any of the patterns if it does it tell us 
# ____ stock shows a rising pattern buy at ___ |stop loss at ___ |sell at ___ for a ___% pay out  (__%sure/match)
# or
# ____ stock shows a dropping pattern short at ___ | stop loss at ___| but at ____ | for a __% pay out (___%sure/match) - stop loss = if the stock drops we win
